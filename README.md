Bank Customer - Churn Analysis

## Motivation:

With increasing competition in the banking sector, most of the banks are facing issues with retaining their customers. An European Bank (Let's call it- 'We Love Your Money!') has recently observed that it's customers are churning at a higher rate year-over-year. They want to investigate the reasons driving customer churn.
