## Analysis Steps:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Churn Analysis Using K-Nearest Neighbors model (KNN)
- Churn Analysis Using Logistic Regression
- Churn Analysis Using Decision Tree
- Churn Analysis Using Random Forest


## Findings:

#### Findings from the exploratory data analysis:
- Women are more likely to churn than men
- German and older (by age) customers are more likely to churn
- Larger proportion of churned customers have poor credit scores

#### Predicting customers who are more likely to churn:

- Out of the four prediction models, random forest predicted the churned customers with the highest accuracy of 86% (#trees= 1000)
- Age, Estimated Salary, Credit Scores, Number of products turned out to be significant variables



## Recommendations:

- Increase awareness amongst customers on importance of maintaining a healthy credit score
- Customized financial advisory and investment offerings to different segments of customers
